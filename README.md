# WebRTC Experimentation

### This repository has been made for the [Language Learning Project](https://github.com/fredmcgroarty/language_learning_project) in order to  experiment on WebRTC technologies.
#### The web-chat feature of this final project had several goals, all of which has been tested on this repository.
1. Implemented Peer to Peer Connection through SimpleWebRTC
2. Implemented text-chat functionality through Websockets
3. Implemented TimeCircles for countdown functionality
4. Enabled timed link whereby link only appears when a session time is ready (default of 4 seconds after creation)


#### This chat-room feature has been a paired project between [Andrew Cumine](https://github.com/ajcumine) and [Tiffanie Chia](https://github.com/tiffaniechia)


##### The [Language Learning Project](https://github.com/fredmcgroarty/language_learning_project) is a Final Project for [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) by a team of 6:
