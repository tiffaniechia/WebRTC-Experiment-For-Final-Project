##WebRTC Experimentation

This repository has been made for the [Language Learning Project](https://github.com/fredmcgroarty/language_learning_project) in order to  experiment on WebRTC technologies.


The web-chat feature of this final project had several goals, all of which has been tested on this repository:
1. Implemented Peer to Peer Connection through SimpleWebRTC
2. Implemented text-chat functionality through Websockets
3. Implemented TimeCircles for countdown functionality
4. Enabled timed link whereby link only appears when a session time is ready (default of 4 seconds after creation)


##### The [Language Learning Project (POLYGLT)](https://github.com/fredmcgroarty/language_learning_project) is a Final Project for [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). It is social networking site for language learning that utilises WebRTC, websockets, and a whole host of gems.
